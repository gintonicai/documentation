# API Authentication

In this section, we provide a comprehensive guide on how to authenticate and access our platform's API. By following our step-by-step instructions, you'll learn how to generate API keys, set up authentication, and securely connect to our platform.

## Generate API Key

1. Log into your account and navigate to the 'API Keys' section.
2. Generate a new API key and store it securely.\
   Maximum API keys per account: 5
3. New API key is shown and available for copying. You will be informed, that&#x20;

“_API key is shown only once! Write it down and copy to buffer to store securely._”

4. Delete any API key.\
   You can have up to 5 API keys active on your account at any given time. If you have any unnecessary keys, you can delete them by simply clicking the delete button. However, please note that there is no confirmation prompt when deleting a key, so be sure to only delete keys that you no longer need.

If a key is in use - warning "_API key is in use"_ will be shown.
