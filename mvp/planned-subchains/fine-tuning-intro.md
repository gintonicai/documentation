# Fine-tuning Intro

The Gintonic **Fine-Tuning Subchain** is being conceptualized as a tool to help refine and adapt AI models to specific tasks or domains. This subchain will provide capabilities for tweaking pre-trained models, allowing them to be more effectively applied to particular use cases without requiring massive amounts of new data or extensive retraining.

The focus here is on making AI models more versatile and useful across different scenarios. By fine-tuning existing models, organizations could potentially save time and resources, speeding up deployment and enhancing model accuracy for their unique needs.
