# AI Governance Intro

***

The Gintonic **AI Governance Subchain** is being conceptualized as a framework for ensuring that AI models and applications developed within the ecosystem adhere to ethical standards, regulatory requirements, and best practices. This subchain will focus on implementing governance protocols that oversee the development, deployment, and ongoing management of AI technologies, ensuring that they are used responsibly and transparently.

The AI Governance Subchain is expected to provide mechanisms for auditing AI models, monitoring compliance with regulations, and enforcing ethical guidelines throughout the AI lifecycle. By offering a structured approach to governance, this subchain aims to build trust and accountability within the ecosystem, fostering an environment where AI can be developed and deployed with confidence. It will be instrumental in helping organizations navigate the complexities of AI ethics and regulation, ensuring that their AI initiatives align with broader societal values and legal standards.
