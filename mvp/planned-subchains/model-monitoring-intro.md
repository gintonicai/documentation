# Model Monitoring Intro

The Gintonic **Model Monitoring Subchain** is set to provide tools for keeping AI models running smoothly after theyâ€™ve been deployed. This subchain will offer real-time monitoring of performance metrics like accuracy and resource usage, helping developers spot and fix issues before they become serious problems.

The goal is to ensure that AI models continue to perform well over time, even as conditions change. By providing ongoing insights into how models are functioning, the Model Monitoring Subchain aims to help organizations maintain the reliability and effectiveness of their AI solutions.
