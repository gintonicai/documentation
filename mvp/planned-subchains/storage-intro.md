# Storage Intro

The Gintonic **Storage Subchain** is planned as a foundational element for managing data within the ecosystem. This subchain will focus on providing secure, scalable, and efficient storage solutions tailored to the needs of AI applications. By offering a decentralized approach to data storage, it aims to ensure that large datasets, AI models, and other critical assets are readily accessible and protected against unauthorized access.

The Storage Subchain is expected to handle various types of data, from raw datasets to fully trained models, and provide tools for version control, access management, and data retrieval. The emphasis will be on reliability and security, making it a trusted resource for developers and organizations looking to manage their AI-related data assets effectively. As data plays a central role in AI development, this subchain is envisioned as a key enabler for seamless data management across the entire ecosystem.
