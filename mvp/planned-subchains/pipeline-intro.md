# pipeline intro

The gintonic **AI Pipeline Subchain** is envisioned as a tool to automate the various steps involved in developing AI models, from data collection to deployment. The plan is to offer a visual interface that allows users to create and manage AI workflows without needing to write extensive code.

This subchain is expected to make the AI development process faster and more efficient by automating routine tasks. By reducing the time and effort required to manage AI pipelines, the AI Pipeline Subchain could help teams focus on innovation and fine-tuning their models, rather than getting bogged down in operational details.
