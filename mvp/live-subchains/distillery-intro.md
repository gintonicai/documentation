# distillery intro

## Overview

A **gintonic distillery subchain** forms the backbone of distributed AI inference within the gintonic ecosystem. Leveraging the innovative [Petals framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01188), this subchain enables a network of GPU-powered nodes to collaboratively process large language models, making advanced AI capabilities accessible to a wider audience.

## How It Works

At its core, the distillery subchain allows individuals and organizations to contribute their GPU resources to a decentralized network. These "distillers" receive blocks of inference tasks, which their GPUs process as part of a larger, distributed AI model. This approach breaks down the computational barriers that typically restrict access to state-of-the-art AI models, democratizing AI inference.

The processed inferences are then seamlessly integrated into the gintonic ecosystem through the inference subchain, which exposes these capabilities via an API. This integration allows developers and applications to tap into powerful AI models without the need for extensive local resources, opening up new possibilities for AI-driven innovation across various sectors.

## Benefits for Participants

Participation in the distillery subchain comes with tangible benefits for contributors:

* **Earn Rewards**: Distillers are rewarded with $GIN, the native token of the gintonic ecosystem, for their computational contributions.
* **Economic Incentives**: This creates an economic incentive for users to join the network, fostering the growth of a robust, decentralized AI infrastructure.
* **Utilize Idle Resources**: Participants can earn rewards for their idle GPU resources, maximizing the utility of their hardware.

## Join the Revolution

By joining the distillery subchain, users become part of a groundbreaking initiative that aims to reshape the landscape of AI accessibility. Whether you're an individual with a high-end GPU or an organization with surplus computational power, the distillery subchain offers an opportunity to:

1. Contribute to the advancement of AI technology
2. Participate in a decentralized AI infrastructure
