# Welcome to gintonic hub

Hey there, AI enthusiast! You've just stumbled upon the beating heart of our decentralized AI ecosystem. Buckle up, because we're about to take you on a wild ride through the world of gintonic.

## So, what's the deal with gintonic?

Picture this: a Level 0 blockchain that's like the cool older sibling to a bunch of AI-focused subchains. It's not trying to do everything itself (because let's face it, that never ends well). Instead, gintonic is the master conductor, making sure all these specialized AI services play nice together.

## Why subchains? Because teamwork makes the dream work

Look, AI isn't a one-size-fits-all game. That's why we've built gintonic like a Swiss Army knife of AI services. Each subchain does its own thing, but they're all connected through our Level 0 chain. It's like having a bunch of AI specialists at a party, and gintonic is the host making sure everyone mingles.

This setup lets us:
* Share data without the usual headaches
* Let each subchain run its own show (governance-wise)
* Grow big or stay small, depending on what each subchain needs

It's flexible, it's scalable, and it's ready for whatever curveballs the AI world throws our way.

## Let's talk subchains – the real MVPs

We've got a whole lineup of subchains, but let me introduce you to the stars of the show:

1. [**distillery subchain**](distillery-subchain-guide/): This bad boy is all about raw computing power. Need GPUs to train your beast of an AI model? distillery's got your back. It's like Airbnb, but for GPU power. Pretty cool, right?

2. [**inference subchain**](inference-subchain-guide/): Once you've trained your model and it's ready to face the world, inference is where the magic happens. This subchain is built for speed, letting you use your AI in real-time without breaking a sweat.

And here's the kicker – these subchains aren't just doing their own thing in isolation. Thanks to gintonic, they're all part of one big, happy family. Train your model on distillery, deploy it on inference, and watch as gintonic makes sure everything runs smooth as butter.

## Ready to jump in? Here's your gameplan:

1. **Scope out the scene**: Check out our [Live Subchains Directory](live-subchains/) and peek at what's coming up in [Planned Subchains](planned-subchains/). Trust me, you'll want to know what's cooking.

2. **Join the party**: Our [Discord](https://discord.gg/3xH9MHpn) is where all the cool kids hang out. Got questions? Need help? Want to brag about your latest AI project? That's the place to be.

Remember, gintonic isn't just another tech platform. We're building a community here, and we need your brainpower to shape the future of AI. So don't be shy – dive in and make your mark!

Let's show the world what decentralized AI can really do!
