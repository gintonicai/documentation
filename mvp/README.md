# Overview

## Welcome to gintonic!

Welcome to our unified decentralized AI ecosystem! Our platform is designed to transform the way AI is developed and deployed, providing a more efficient and streamlined approach to AI development. 

Our ecosystem leverages the power of blockchain technology to create a decentralized network of specialized subchains, each tailored for specific AI tasks and services. This allows us to provide high-performance, low-latency services for a wide range of AI applications.

By using specialized subchains, we can provide developers with access to the tools and resources they need to build and deploy AI models quickly and easily. Our platform also enables developers to monetize their AI services, creating new opportunities for innovation and growth in the AI industry.

In addition to our specialized subchains, our platform also includes a range of tools and resources for AI development, including pre-trained models, datasets, and development frameworks. Our platform is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing us to adapt to the ever-evolving needs of the AI industry.

## What is Mixtral?&#x20;

**Mixtral** is a sparse mixture of experts (SMoE) model developed by Mistral AI. This model, specifically the [Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1), features 45 billion parameters but performs inference as if it had only 13 billion active parameters. This allows for significantly faster and more efficient performance compared to larger models.

## What is configurtion?&#x20;

**AI model configuration** is a set of parameters and settings that define the architecture and behaviour of an artificial neural network or other machine model used to solve artificial intelligence problems.

## What is fine-tuning?&#x20; 

**Fine-tuning** is the process of adjusting a pre-trained machine learning model to improve its performance on a specific task. In fine tuning, a pre-trained model is used as a starting point and its parameters are adjusted to better match the target task data
