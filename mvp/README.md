# Gintonic Hub

Welcome to the Gintonic Hub, the central nervous system of our decentralized AI ecosystem. Here, you'll find everything you need to understand and leverage the power of Gintonic for your AI projects.

## What is Gintonic?

At its core, Gintonic is a Level 0 blockchain that serves as the foundation for a network of interconnected AI-focused subchains. Think of it as the backbone that allows various specialized AI services to communicate and work together seamlessly.

## The Power of Interconnected Subchains

Gintonic's architecture is built on the idea that AI development is multifaceted and requires different specialized services. Instead of trying to cram everything into one chain, we've created a modular system where each subchain can focus on what it does best.

Our Level 0 chain acts as a hub, enabling these subchains to:
- Share data and resources efficiently
- Maintain their own governance and upgrade schedules
- Scale independently based on their specific needs

This approach allows for a flexible, scalable, and robust AI ecosystem that can adapt to the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence.

## Subchains in Action

While Gintonic supports a wide array of subchains, let's look at two key examples to illustrate how this works in practice:

1. **Distillery Subchain**: This is where the raw power of AI computation is harnessed. It's a marketplace for GPU resources, allowing developers to access the computing power they need for training and running complex AI models.

2. **Inference Subchain**: Once models are trained, they need to be deployed and used. The Inference subchain specializes in fast, efficient model execution, making it possible to use AI models in real-time applications.

These subchains, while specializing in different areas, can work together seamlessly thanks to the Gintonic Level 0 blockchain. For instance, a model trained using resources from the Distillery subchain can be easily deployed for inference, with the Level 0 chain facilitating the necessary data and state transfers.
