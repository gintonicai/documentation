# Glossary of Terms

## Glossary of Terms

Welcome to the gintonic Distillery glossary! Here, we'll break down the jargon and technical terms you might encounter while operating your node. Don't worry if it seems like a lot at first - you'll be speaking "gintonic" in no time!

### A

#### AI (Artificial Intelligence)

The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. In the context of gintonic, it refers to the complex computations your GPU is helping to process.

#### Artifact

In the gintonic ecosystem, an artifact refers to a piece of data or a result produced by an AI model during processing.

### B

#### Blockchain

A decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions across many computers. gintonic uses blockchain to ensure transparent and secure reward distribution.

### D

#### Decentralized Network

A network where control and decision-making are distributed among participants rather than centralized in a single authority. gintonic is built on this principle.

#### Docker

A platform used to develop, ship, and run applications inside containers. We use Docker to make node setup and management easier for you.

### G

#### GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)

A specialized processor originally designed to accelerate graphics rendering. In our context, GPUs are used for their ability to perform complex calculations quickly, making them ideal for AI tasks.

#### $GIN

The native cryptocurrency of the gintonic network. You earn $GIN tokens as rewards for contributing your GPU's computing power.

### I

#### Inference

The process of using a trained AI model to make predictions or decisions. Your node helps in running these inferences.

### N

#### Node

In the gintonic network, a node is your computer running the gintonic Distillery software, contributing GPU power to the network.

### P

#### Peer ID

A unique identifier assigned to your node when it joins the gintonic network. It's used to track your node's contributions and distribute rewards.

#### Public Address

Your blockchain wallet address where you receive $GIN rewards. It's linked to your Peer ID in our system.

### S

#### Smart Contract

Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. gintonic uses smart contracts to automate reward distribution.

#### Swarm

The collective of all nodes in the gintonic network working together to process AI tasks.

### T

#### Token

A type of cryptocurrency that represents an asset or specific use on a blockchain. $GIN is the token used in the gintonic ecosystem.

### V

#### VRAM (Video RAM)

The dedicated memory on your GPU. The amount of VRAM affects the complexity and size of AI tasks your node can handle.

### W

#### Wallet

A digital tool that allows you to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies. You'll need a wallet compatible with $GIN to receive your rewards.
