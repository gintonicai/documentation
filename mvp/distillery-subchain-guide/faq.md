### General Questions

#### Q: What exactly is gintonic Distillery?

> gintonic Distillery is a decentralized platform that allows GPU owners to contribute their computing power to AI tasks in exchange for $GIN. It's like mining for cryptocurrency, but instead of solving arbitrary puzzles, your GPU is helping to advance AI technology.

#### Q: Do I need to be a tech expert to run a gintonic node?

> Not at all! We've designed the process to be as user-friendly as possible. If you can follow step-by-step instructions and are comfortable using a command line interface, you should be able to set up and run a node.

### Setup and Requirements

#### Q: What kind of GPU do I need?

> Currently, gintonic supports NVIDIA GPUs with at least 8GB of VRAM. The more powerful your GPU, the more tasks it can handle and potentially the more $GIN you can earn.

#### Q: Can I run a node on my gaming PC?

> Yes, you can! However, remember that while your node is processing tasks, it may impact the performance of other GPU-intensive activities like gaming. You can adjust the GPU allocation in your config file to balance between gintonic tasks and other uses.

#### Q: Do I need to leave my computer on 24/7?

> While you don't _need_ to, your node earns $GIN only when it's online and processing tasks. Keeping your node online more consistently will likely result in more earnings.

### Earnings and Rewards

#### Q: How much $GIN can I expect to earn?

> Earnings can vary widely based on your GPU's capabilities, how often your node is online, and the current demand for processing power on the network. We recommend running your node for at least a month to get a good sense of potential earnings.

#### Q: When do I receive my $GIN rewards?

> Rewards are calculated and distributed continuously as your node completes tasks. You can check your current balance on the gintonic Rewards Dashboard at any time.

#### Q: Can I exchange $GIN for other cryptocurrencies or fiat money?

> Yes, $GIN can be traded on various cryptocurrency exchanges. However, the availability of trading pairs may vary. Check our website for the most up-to-date information on where $GIN is listed.

### Technical Questions

#### Q: What happens if my internet connection drops?

> If your internet connection is interrupted, your node will automatically try to reconnect when the connection is restored. Any in-progress tasks that were interrupted may need to be reprocessed, but this won't negatively affect your standing in the network.

#### Q: How can I monitor my node's performance?

> You can check your node's status on our Node Monitor Page. For more detailed information, you can access your node's logs as described in the "Managing Your Node" section of this documentation.

#### Q: Is it safe to run a gintonic node? Are there any security risks?

> We've designed the gintonic node software with security in mind. It runs in a Docker container, which provides a level of isolation from your system. However, as with any software that connects to the internet, it's important to keep your system updated and follow good security practices.

### Community and Support

#### Q: Where can I get help if I'm having issues with my node?

> Our community forums and Discord channel are great places to start. Many experienced node operators are active there and can often help with common issues. For more persistent problems, you can reach out to our support team via email.

#### Q: Can I contribute to the development of gintonic?

> Absolutely! We're always looking for community contributions. Whether it's suggesting improvements, reporting bugs, or even contributing code if you're a developer, we welcome your input. Check our GitHub repository or community forums for ways to get involved.
